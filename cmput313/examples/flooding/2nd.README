This directory also contains a couple of files to help plot statistics
of the execution of the 3 flooding algorithms.
The shellscript  getfloodstats :

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    EVERY=5         # seconds
    #
    rm -f result.flood*
    #
    for f in 1 2 3
    do
        cnet -W -q -T -e 20mins -s -f ${EVERY}secs FLOODING$f  | \
        grep 'Messages delivered'                              | \
        cut -d: -f 2                                           | \
        awk "{ printf(\"%d %s\n\", ++i * $EVERY, \$1); }"      > result.flood$f
    done

runs each implementation for 20 minutes of simulated time, and
captures their statistics every 5 seconds in files named result.flood1,
result.flood2....

These files are then used by GNUPLOT to plot all statistics on one graph,
using the GNUPLOT command file  plotfloodstats.gp :

    #
    set title "Comparison of 3 flooding protocols"
    set xlabel "Running time (seconds)"
    set ylabel "Messages delivered"
    #
    set grid
    set yrange [0:]
    #
    plot        \
            "result.flood1"  title "flooding1" with linespoints, \
            "result.flood2"  title "flooding2" with linespoints, \
            "result.flood3"  title "flooding3" with linespoints
    #
    pause -1

Don't be concerned if both flooding1 and flooding2 terminate with the error:

    Error while executing Melbourne, dll_basic.c, function down_to_datalink(), 
    ER_TOOBUSY: Function is too busy/congested to handle request

However, *do* try to understand why they report this.

In combination, these two files plot the number of messages successfully
delivered by each flooding implementation.  You may easily change the
collated statistic by:

    - editing the string 'Messages delivered' in getfloodstats
      to, say, 'Efficiency', and
    - editing the value of ylabel in plotfloodstats.gp
