This simple example demonstrates how a node can be informed about
a change in a link's state with EV_LINKSTATE.  Run with:

	cnet LINKSTATE

If a link is changed with the right mouse button, or if the attributes
linkmtbf and linkmttr are set in the topology file, link_changed()
will be called with its third parameter set to the number of the
link whose state has changed.

This example determines if, and for how long, a node is isolated
from the rest of the network.
