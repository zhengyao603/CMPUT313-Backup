/*  This simple example demonstrates how a node can catch a change
    in a link's state with EV_LINKSTATE.
    If a link is changed with the right mouse button, or if linkmtbf
    and linkmttr are set in the topology file, link_changed() will be
    called with its third parameter set to the number of the link whose
    state has changed.

    This example determines if, and for how long, a node is isolated 
    from the rest of the network.
